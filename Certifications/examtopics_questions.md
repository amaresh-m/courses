### Question 9

![Question 9 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_9_img_1.png)

A junior member of the data engineering team is exploring the language interoperability of Databricks notebooks. The intended outcome of the below code is to register a view of all sales that occurred in countries on the continent of Africa that appear in the geo_lookup table.Before executing the code, running SHOW TABLES on the current database indicates the database contains only two tables: geo_lookup and sales.Which statement correctly describes the outcome of executing these command cells in order in an interactive notebook?

---

### Question 11

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern?

- A.Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.
- B.Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.
- C.Because Delta Lake time travel provides full access to the entire history of a table, deleted records can always be recreated by users with full admin privileges.
- D.Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.
- E.Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.

### Question 13

An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.Which solution meets these requirements?

- A.Create a separate history table for each pk_id resolve the current state of the table by running a union all filtering the history tables for the most recent state.
- B.Use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a bronze table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.
- C.Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn; rely on Delta Lake's versioning ability to create an audit log.
- D.Use Delta Lake's change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.
- E.Ingest all log information into a bronze table; use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a silver table to recreate the current table state.

---

### Question 14

An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema: user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINTNew records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.Assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly, which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job?

- A.Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger once job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.
- B.Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.
- C.Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_iogin by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.
- D.Use Delta Lake version history to get the difference between the latest version of account_history and one version prior, then write these records to account_current.
- E.Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.

---

### Question 15

A table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records?

- A.Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.
- B.Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.
- C.Calculate the difference between the previous model predictions and the current customer_churn_params on a key identifying unique customers before making new predictions; only make predictions on those customers not in the previous predictions.
- D.Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.
- E.Replace the current overwrite logic with a merge statement to modify only those records that have changed; write logic to make predictions on the changed records identified by the change data feed.

### Question 16

![Question 16 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_16_img_1.png)

A table is registered with the following code:Both users and orders are Delta Lake tables. Which statement describes the results of querying recent_orders?

- A.All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query finishes.
- B.All logic will execute when the table is defined and store the result of joining tables to the DBFS; this stored data will be returned when the table is queried.
- C.Results will be computed and cached when the table is defined; these cached results will incrementally update as new records are inserted into source tables.
- D.All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query began.
- E.The versions of each source table will be stored in the table transaction log; query results will be saved to DBFS with each query.

---

### Question 17

A production workload incrementally applies updates from an external Change Data Capture feed to a Delta Lake table as an always-on Structured Stream job. When data was initially migrated for this table, OPTIMIZE was executed and most data files were resized to 1 GB. Auto Optimize and Auto Compaction were both turned on for the streaming production job. Recent review of data files shows that most data files are under 64 MB, although each partition in the table contains at least 1 GB of data and the total table size is over 10 TB.Which of the following likely explains these smaller file sizes?

- A.Databricks has autotuned to a smaller target file size to reduce duration of MERGE operations
- B.Z-order indices calculated on the table are preventing file compaction
- C.Bloom filter indices calculated on the table are preventing file compaction
- D.Databricks has autotuned to a smaller target file size based on the overall size of data in the table
- E.Databricks has autotuned to a smaller target file size based on the amount of data in each partition

---

### Question 18

- B.Each microbatch of a stream-static join will use the most recent version of the static Delta table as of the job's initialization.
- C.The checkpoint directory will be used to track state information for the unique keys present in the join.
- D.Stream-static joins cannot use static Delta tables because of consistency issues.
- E.The checkpoint directory will be used to track updates to the static Delta table.

### Question 19

![Question 19 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_19_img_1.png)

A junior data engineer has been asked to develop a streaming data pipeline with a grouped aggregation using DataFrame df. The pipeline needs to calculate the average humidity and average temperature for each non-overlapping five-minute interval. Events are recorded once per minute per device.Streaming DataFrame df has the following schema:"device_id INT, event_time TIMESTAMP, temp FLOAT, humidity FLOAT"Code block:Choose the response that correctly fills in the blank within the code block to complete this task.

- A.to_interval("event_time", "5 minutes").alias("time")
- B.window("event_time", "5 minutes").alias("time")
- C."event_time"
- D.window("event_time", "10 minutes").alias("time")
- E.lag("event_time", "10 minutes").alias("time")

### Question 20

![Question 20 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_20_img_1.png)

A data architect has designed a system in which two Structured Streaming jobs will concurrently write to a single bronze Delta table. Each job is subscribing to a different topic from an Apache Kafka source, but they will write data with the same schema. To keep the directory structure simple, a data engineer has decided to nest a checkpoint directory to be shared by both streams.The proposed directory structure is displayed below:Which statement describes whether this checkpoint directory structure is valid for the given scenario and why?

- A.No; Delta Lake manages streaming checkpoints in the transaction log.
- B.Yes; both of the streams can share a single checkpoint directory.
- C.No; only one stream can write to a Delta Lake table.
- D.Yes; Delta Lake supports infinite concurrent writers.
- E.No; each of the streams needs to have its own checkpoint directory.

---

### Question 21

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement?

- A.Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.
- B.Increase the trigger interval to 30 seconds; setting the trigger interval near the maximum execution time observed for each batch is always best practice to ensure no records are dropped.
- C.The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.
- D.Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.
- E.Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill.

---

### Question 22

Which statement describes Delta Lake Auto Compaction?

- A.An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 1 GB.
- B.Before a Jobs cluster terminates, OPTIMIZE is executed on all tables modified during the most recent job.
- C.Optimized writes use logical partitions instead of directory partitions; because partition boundaries are only represented in metadata, fewer small files are written.
- D.Data is queued in a messaging bus instead of committing data directly to memory; all data is committed from the messaging bus in one batch once the job is complete.
- E.An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 128 MB.

---

### Question 23

Which statement characterizes the general programming model used by Spark Structured Streaming?

- A.Structured Streaming leverages the parallel processing of GPUs to achieve highly parallel data throughput.
- B.Structured Streaming is implemented as a messaging bus and is derived from Apache Kafka.
- C.Structured Streaming uses specialized hardware and I/O streams to achieve sub-second latency for data transfer.
- D.Structured Streaming models new data arriving in a data stream as new rows appended to an unbounded table.
- E.Structured Streaming relies on a distributed network of nodes that hold incremental state values for cached stages.

### Question 24

Which configuration parameter directly affects the size of a spark-partition upon ingestion of data into Spark?

- A.spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes
- B.spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold
- C.spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes
- D.spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.minPartitionNum
- E.spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes

---

### Question 25

A Spark job is taking longer than expected. Using the Spark UI, a data engineer notes that the Min, Median, and Max Durations for tasks in a particular stage show the minimum and median time to complete a task as roughly the same, but the max duration for a task to be roughly 100 times as long as the minimum.Which situation is causing increased duration of the overall job?

- A.Task queueing resulting from improper thread pool assignment.
- B.Spill resulting from attached volume storage being too small.
- C.Network latency due to some cluster nodes being in different regions from the source data
- D.Skew caused by more data being assigned to a subset of spark-partitions.
- E.Credential validation errors while pulling data from an external system.

### Question 28

![Question 28 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_28_img_1.png)

A junior data engineer seeks to leverage Delta Lake's Change Data Feed functionality to create a Type 1 table representing all of the values that have ever been valid for all rows in a bronze table created with the property delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true. They plan to execute the following code as a daily job:Which statement describes the execution and results of running the above query multiple times?

- A.Each time the job is executed, newly updated records will be merged into the target table, overwriting previous values with the same primary keys.
- B.Each time the job is executed, the entire available history of inserted or updated records will be appended to the target table, resulting in many duplicate entries.
- C.Each time the job is executed, the target table will be overwritten using the entire history of inserted or updated records, giving the desired result.
- D.Each time the job is executed, the differences between the original and current versions are calculated; this may result in duplicate entries for some records.
- E.Each time the job is executed, only those records that have been inserted or updated since the last execution will be appended to the target table, giving the desired result.

---

### Question 29

A new data engineer notices that a critical field was omitted from an application that writes its Kafka source to Delta Lake. This happened even though the critical field was in the Kafka source. That field was further missing from data written to dependent, long-term storage. The retention threshold on the Kafka service is seven days. The pipeline has been in production for three months.Which describes how Delta Lake can help to avoid data loss of this nature in the future?

- A.The Delta log and Structured Streaming checkpoints record the full history of the Kafka producer.
- B.Delta Lake schema evolution can retroactively calculate the correct value for newly added fields, as long as the data was in the original source.
- C.Delta Lake automatically checks that all fields present in the source data are included in the ingestion layer.
- D.Data can never be permanently dropped or deleted from Delta Lake, so data loss is not possible under any circumstance.
- E.Ingesting all raw data and metadata from Kafka to a bronze Delta table creates a permanent, replayable history of the data state.

### Question 31

A junior data engineer is working to implement logic for a Lakehouse table named silver_device_recordings. The source data contains 100 unique fields in a highly nested JSON structure.The silver_device_recordings table will be used downstream to power several production monitoring dashboards and a production model. At present, 45 of the 100 fields are being used in at least one of these applications.The data engineer is trying to determine the best approach for dealing with schema declaration given the highly-nested structure of the data and the numerous fields.Which of the following accurately presents information about Delta Lake and Databricks that may impact their decision-making process?

- A.The Tungsten encoding used by Databricks is optimized for storing string data; newly-added native support for querying JSON strings means that string types are always most efficient.
- B.Because Delta Lake uses Parquet for data storage, data types can be easily evolved by just modifying file footer information in place.
- C.Human labor in writing code is the largest cost associated with data engineering workloads; as such, automating table declaration logic should be a priority in all migration workloads.
- D.Because Databricks will infer schema using types that allow all observed data to be processed, setting types manually provides greater assurance of data quality enforcement.
- E.Schema inference and evolution on Databricks ensure that inferred types will always accurately match the data types used by downstream systems.

### Question 32

![Question 32 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_32_img_1.png)

The data engineering team maintains the following code:Assuming that this code produces logically correct results and the data in the source tables has been de-duplicated and validated, which statement describes what will occur when this code is executed?

- A.A batch job will update the enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table, replacing only those rows that have different values than the current version of the table, using accountID as the primary key.
- B.The enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table will be overwritten using the current valid version of data in each of the three tables referenced in the join logic.
- C.An incremental job will leverage information in the state store to identify unjoined rows in the source tables and write these rows to the enriched_iteinized_orders_by_account table.
- D.An incremental job will detect if new rows have been written to any of the source tables; if new rows are detected, all results will be recalculated and used to overwrite the enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table.
- E.No computation will occur until enriched_itemized_orders_by_account is queried; upon query materialization, results will be calculated using the current valid version of data in each of the three tables referenced in the join logic.

---

### Question 33

The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system?

- A.Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.
- B.Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.
- C.Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.
- D.Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.
- E.Because all tables must live in the same storage containers used for the database they're created in, organizations should be prepared to create between dozens and thousands of databases depending on their data isolation requirements.

---

### Question 34

### Question 35

To reduce storage and compute costs, the data engineering team has been tasked with curating a series of aggregate tables leveraged by business intelligence dashboards, customer-facing applications, production machine learning models, and ad hoc analytical queries.The data engineering team has been made aware of new requirements from a customer-facing application, which is the only downstream workload they manage entirely. As a result, an aggregate table used by numerous teams across the organization will need to have a number of fields renamed, and additional fields will also be added.Which of the solutions addresses the situation while minimally interrupting other teams in the organization without increasing the number of tables that need to be managed?

- A.Send all users notice that the schema for the table will be changing; include in the communication the logic necessary to revert the new table schema to match historic queries.
- B.Configure a new table with all the requisite fields and new names and use this as the source for the customer-facing application; create a view that maintains the original data schema and table name by aliasing select fields from the new table.
- C.Create a new table with the required schema and new fields and use Delta Lake's deep clone functionality to sync up changes committed to one table to the corresponding table.
- D.Replace the current table definition with a logical view defined with the query logic currently writing the aggregate table; create a new table to power the customer-facing application.
- E.Add a table comment warning all users that the table schema and field names will be changing on a given date; overwrite the table in place to the specifications of the customer-facing application.

### Question 37

A small company based in the United States has recently contracted a consulting firm in India to implement several new data engineering pipelines to power artificial intelligence applications. All the company's data is stored in regional cloud storage in the United States.The workspace administrator at the company is uncertain about where the Databricks workspace used by the contractors should be deployed.Assuming that all data governance considerations are accounted for, which statement accurately informs this decision?

- A.Databricks runs HDFS on cloud volume storage; as such, cloud virtual machines must be deployed in the region where the data is stored.
- B.Databricks workspaces do not rely on any regional infrastructure; as such, the decision should be made based upon what is most convenient for the workspace administrator.
- C.Cross-region reads and writes can incur significant costs and latency; whenever possible, compute should be deployed in the same region the data is stored.
- D.Databricks leverages user workstations as the driver during interactive development; as such, users should always use a workspace deployed in a region they are physically near.
- E.Databricks notebooks send all executable code from the user’s browser to virtual machines over the open internet; whenever possible, choosing a workspace region near the end users is the most secure.

### Question 38

![Question 38 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_38_img_1.png)

The downstream consumers of a Delta Lake table have been complaining about data quality issues impacting performance in their applications. Specifically, they have complained that invalid latitude and longitude values in the activity_details table have been breaking their ability to use other geolocation processes.A junior engineer has written the following code to add CHECK constraints to the Delta Lake table:A senior engineer has confirmed the above logic is correct and the valid ranges for latitude and longitude are provided, but the code fails when executed.Which statement explains the cause of this failure?

- A.Because another team uses this table to support a frequently running application, two-phase locking is preventing the operation from committing.
- B.The activity_details table already exists; CHECK constraints can only be added during initial table creation.
- C.The activity_details table already contains records that violate the constraints; all existing data must pass CHECK constraints in order to add them to an existing table.
- D.The activity_details table already contains records; CHECK constraints can only be added prior to inserting values into a table.
- E.The current table schema does not contain the field valid_coordinates; schema evolution will need to be enabled before altering the table to add a constraint.

### Question 49

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production?

- A.Scala is the only language that can be accurately tested using interactive notebooks; because the best performance is achieved by using Scala code compiled to JARs, all PySpark and Spark SQL logic should be refactored.
- B.The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks Is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.
- C.Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.
- D.Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.
- E.The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.

---

### Question 73

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement?

- A.Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.
- B.Increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism, since the trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory.
- C.Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.
- D.Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.
- E.Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.

---

### Question 92

In order to prevent accidental commits to production data, a senior data engineer has instituted a policy that all development work will reference clones of Delta Lake tables. After testing both DEEP and SHALLOW CLONE, development tables are created using SHALLOW CLONE.A few weeks after initial table creation, the cloned versions of several tables implemented as Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) stop working. The transaction logs for the source tables show that VACUUM was run the day before.Which statement describes why the cloned tables are no longer working?

- A.Because Type 1 changes overwrite existing records, Delta Lake cannot guarantee data consistency for cloned tables.

- B.All records will be held in the state store for 2 hours before being deduplicated and committed to the orders table.
- C.The orders table will contain only the most recent 2 hours of records and no duplicates will be present.
- D.Duplicate records arriving more than 2 hours apart will be dropped, but duplicates that arrive in the same batch may both be written to the orders table.
- E.The orders table will not contain duplicates, but records arriving more than 2 hours late will be ignored and missing from the table.

---

### Question 96

A junior data engineer is migrating a workload from a relational database system to the Databricks Lakehouse. The source system uses a star schema, leveraging foreign key constraints and multi-table inserts to validate records on write.Which consideration will impact the decisions made by the engineer while migrating this workload?

- A.Databricks only allows foreign key constraints on hashed identifiers, which avoid collisions in highly-parallel writes.
- B.Databricks supports Spark SQL and JDBC; all logic can be directly migrated from the source system without refactoring.
- C.Committing to multiple tables simultaneously requires taking out multiple table locks and can lead to a state of deadlock.
- D.All Delta Lake transactions are ACID compliant against a single table, and Databricks does not enforce foreign key constraints.
- E.Foreign keys must reference a primary key field; multi-table inserts must leverage Delta Lake’s upsert functionality.

---

### Question 97

A data architect has heard about Delta Lake’s built-in versioning and time travel capabilities. For auditing purposes, they have a requirement to maintain a full record of all valid street addresses as they appear in the customers table.The architect is interested in implementing a Type 1 table, overwriting existing records with new values and relying on Delta Lake time travel to support long-term auditing. A data engineer on the project feels that a Type 2 table will provide better performance and scalability.Which piece of information is critical to this decision?

- A.Data corruption can occur if a query fails in a partially completed state because Type 2 tables require setting multiple fields in a single update.
- B.Shallow clones can be combined with Type 1 tables to accelerate historic queries for long-term versioning.
- C.Delta Lake time travel cannot be used to query previous versions of these tables because Type 1 changes modify data files in place.
- D.Delta Lake time travel does not scale well in cost or latency to provide a long-term versioning solution.
- E.Delta Lake only supports Type 0 tables; once records are inserted to a Delta Lake table, they cannot be modified.

The following logic has been implemented to propagate delete requests from the user_lookup table to the user_aggregates table.Assuming that user_id is a unique identifying key and that all users that have requested deletion have been removed from the user_lookup table, which statement describes whether successfully executing the above logic guarantees that the records to be deleted from the user_aggregates table are no longer accessible and why?

- A.No; the Delta Lake DELETE command only provides ACID guarantees when combined with the MERGE INTO command.
- B.No; files containing deleted records may still be accessible with time travel until a VACUUM command is used to remove invalidated data files.
- C.Yes; the change data feed uses foreign keys to ensure delete consistency throughout the Lakehouse.
- D.Yes; Delta Lake ACID guarantees provide assurance that the DELETE command succeeded fully and permanently purged these records.
- E.No; the change data feed only tracks inserts and updates, not deleted records.

### Question 106

A nightly batch job is configured to ingest all data files from a cloud object storage container where records are stored in a nested directory structure YYYY/MM/DD. The data for each date represents all records that were processed by the source system on that date, noting that some records may be delayed as they await moderator approval. Each entry represents a user review of a product and has the following schema:user_id STRING, review_id BIGINT, product_id BIGINT, review_timestamp TIMESTAMP, review_text STRINGThe ingestion job is configured to append all data for the previous date to a target table reviews_raw with an identical schema to the source system.

### Question 107

Which statement describes Delta Lake optimized writes?

- A.Before a Jobs cluster terminates, OPTIMIZE is executed on all tables modified during the most recent job.
- B.An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 1 GB.
- C.Data is queued in a messaging bus instead of committing data directly to memory; all data is committed from the messaging bus in one batch once the job is complete.
- D.Optimized writes use logical partitions instead of directory partitions; because partition boundaries are only represented in metadata, fewer small files are written.

### Question 116

The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.Which statement captures best practices for this situation?

- A.All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.
- B.In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.
- C.As long as code in the development environment declares USE dev_db at the top of each notebook, there is no possibility of inadvertently committing changes back to production data sources.
- D.Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.
- E.Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.

### Question 117

A data engineer, User A, has promoted a pipeline to production by using the REST API to programmatically create several jobs. A DevOps engineer, User B, has configured an external orchestration tool to trigger job runs through the REST API. Both users authorized the REST API calls using their personal access tokens.A workspace admin, User C, inherits responsibility for managing this pipeline. User C uses the Databricks Jobs UI to take "Owner" privileges of each job. Jobs continue to be triggered using the credentials and tooling configured by User B.An application has been configured to collect and parse run information returned by the REST API. Which statement describes the value returned in the creator_user_name field?

- A.Once User C takes "Owner" privileges, their email address will appear in this field; prior to this, User A’s email address will appear in this field.
- B.User B’s email address will always appear in this field, as their credentials are always used to trigger the run.
- C.User A’s email address will always appear in this field, as they still own the underlying notebooks.
- D.Once User C takes "Owner" privileges, their email address will appear in this field; prior to this, User B’s email address will appear in this field.
- E.User C will only ever appear in this field if they manually trigger the job, otherwise it will indicate User B.

### Question 128

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern?

- A.Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.
- B.Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.
- C.Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.
- D.Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.

### Question 132

An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema:user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINTNew records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.Which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly?

- A.Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.
- B.Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger available job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.
- C.Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.
- D.Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_login by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.

![Question 133 Image 2](examtopics_images/question_133_img_2.png)

The business intelligence team has a dashboard configured to track various summary metrics for retail stores. This includes total sales for the previous day alongside totals and averages for a variety of time periods. The fields required to populate this dashboard have the following schema:For demand forecasting, the Lakehouse contains a validated table of all itemized sales updated incrementally in near real-time. This table, named products_per_order, includes the following fields:Because reporting on long-term sales trends is less volatile, analysts using the new dashboard only require data to be refreshed once daily. Because the dashboard will be queried interactively by many users throughout a normal business day, it should return results quickly and reduce total compute associated with each materialization.Which solution meets the expectations of the end users while controlling and limiting possible costs?

- A.Populate the dashboard by configuring a nightly batch job to save the required values as a table overwritten with each update.
- B.Use Structured Streaming to configure a live dashboard against the products_per_order table within a Databricks notebook.
- C.Define a view against the products_per_order table and define the dashboard against this view.
- D.Use the Delta Cache to persist the products_per_order table in memory to quickly update the dashboard with each query.

### Question 134

A Delta lake table with CDF enabled table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records?

- A.Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.
- B.Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.
- C.Replace the current overwrite logic with a merge statement to modify only those records that have changed; write logic to make predictions on the changed records identified by the change data feed.
- D.Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.

- B.Results will be computed and cached when the view is defined; these cached results will incrementally update as new records are inserted into source tables.
- C.All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query finishes.
- D.All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query began.

---

### Question 136

A data ingestion task requires a one-TB JSON dataset to be written out to Parquet with a target part-file size of 512 MB. Because Parquet is being used instead of Delta Lake, built-in file-sizing features such as Auto-Optimize & Auto-Compaction cannot be used.Which strategy will yield the best performance without shuffling data?

- A.Set spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes to 512 MB, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, and then write to parquet.
- B.Set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, optimize the data by sorting it (which automatically repartitions the data), and then write to parquet.
- C.Set spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes to 512 MB bytes, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, coalesce to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), and then write to parquet.

### Question 138

![Question 138 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_138_img_1.png)

A junior data engineer has been asked to develop a streaming data pipeline with a grouped aggregation using DataFrame df. The pipeline needs to calculate the average humidity and average temperature for each non-overlapping five-minute interval. Events are recorded once per minute per device.Streaming DataFrame df has the following schema:"device_id INT, event_time TIMESTAMP, temp FLOAT, humidity FLOAT"Code block:Which line of code correctly fills in the blank within the code block to complete this task?

- A.to_interval("event_time", "5 minutes").alias("time")
- B.window("event_time", "5 minutes").alias("time")
- C."event_time"
- D.lag("event_time", "10 minutes").alias("time")

---

### Question 139

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement?

- A.Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.
- B.Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.
- C.Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.
- D.Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.

---

### Question 140

Which statement describes Delta Lake optimized writes?

- A.Before a Jobs cluster terminates, OPTIMIZE is executed on all tables modified during the most recent job.
- B.An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 1 GB.
- C.A shuffle occurs prior to writing to try to group similar data together resulting in fewer files instead of each executor writing multiple files based on directory partitions.
- D.Optimized writes use logical partitions instead of directory partitions; because partition boundaries are only represented in metadata, fewer small files are written.

---

### Question 141

Which statement characterizes the general programming model used by Spark Structured Streaming?

### Question 143

A Spark job is taking longer than expected. Using the Spark UI, a data engineer notes that the Min, Median, and Max Durations for tasks in a particular stage show the minimum and median time to complete a task as roughly the same, but the max duration for a task to be roughly 100 times as long as the minimum.Which situation is causing increased duration of the overall job?

- A.Task queueing resulting from improper thread pool assignment.
- B.Spill resulting from attached volume storage being too small.
- C.Network latency due to some cluster nodes being in different regions from the source data
- D.Skew caused by more data being assigned to a subset of spark-partitions.

A junior data engineer seeks to leverage Delta Lake's Change Data Feed functionality to create a Type 1 table representing all of the values that have ever been valid for all rows in a bronze table created with the property delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true. They plan to execute the following code as a daily job:Which statement describes the execution and results of running the above query multiple times?

- A.Each time the job is executed, newly updated records will be merged into the target table, overwriting previous values with the same primary keys.
- B.Each time the job is executed, the entire available history of inserted or updated records will be appended to the target table, resulting in many duplicate entries.
- C.Each time the job is executed, only those records that have been inserted or updated since the last execution will be appended to the target table, giving the desired result.
- D.Each time the job is executed, the differences between the original and current versions are calculated; this may result in duplicate entries for some records.

A junior data engineer is working to implement logic for a Lakehouse table named silver_device_recordings. The source data contains 100 unique fields in a highly nested JSON structure.The silver_device_recordings table will be used downstream to power several production monitoring dashboards and a production model. At present, 45 of the 100 fields are being used in at least one of these applications.The data engineer is trying to determine the best approach for dealing with schema declaration given the highly-nested structure of the data and the numerous fields.Which of the following accurately presents information about Delta Lake and Databricks that may impact their decision-making process?

- A.The Tungsten encoding used by Databricks is optimized for storing string data; newly-added native support for querying JSON strings means that string types are always most efficient.
- B.Because Delta Lake uses Parquet for data storage, data types can be easily evolved by just modifying file footer information in place.
- C.Schema inference and evolution on Databricks ensure that inferred types will always accurately match the data types used by downstream systems.
- D.Because Databricks will infer schema using types that allow all observed data to be processed, setting types manually provides greater assurance of data quality enforcement.

### Question 152

![Question 152 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_152_img_1.png)

The data engineering team maintains the following code:Assuming that this code produces logically correct results and the data in the source tables has been de-duplicated and validated, which statement describes what will occur when this code is executed?

- A.A batch job will update the enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table, replacing only those rows that have different values than the current version of the table, using accountID as the primary key.
- B.The enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table will be overwritten using the current valid version of data in each of the three tables referenced in the join logic.
- C.No computation will occur until enriched_itemized_orders_by_account is queried; upon query materialization, results will be calculated using the current valid version of data in each of the three tables referenced in the join logic.
- D.An incremental job will detect if new rows have been written to any of the source tables; if new rows are detected, all results will be recalculated and used to overwrite the enriched_itemized_orders_by_account table.

### Question 153

The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.Which statement captures best practices for this situation?

- A.All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.
- B.In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.
- C.Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.
- D.Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.

---

### Question 154

### Question 157

A small company based in the United States has recently contracted a consulting firm in India to implement several new data engineering pipelines to power artificial intelligence applications. All the company's data is stored in regional cloud storage in the United States.The workspace administrator at the company is uncertain about where the Databricks workspace used by the contractors should be deployed.Assuming that all data governance considerations are accounted for, which statement accurately informs this decision?

- A.Databricks runs HDFS on cloud volume storage; as such, cloud virtual machines must be deployed in the region where the data is stored.
- B.Databricks workspaces do not rely on any regional infrastructure; as such, the decision should be made based upon what is most convenient for the workspace administrator.
- C.Cross-region reads and writes can incur significant costs and latency; whenever possible, compute should be deployed in the same region the data is stored.
- D.Databricks notebooks send all executable code from the user’s browser to virtual machines over the open internet; whenever possible, choosing a workspace region near the end users is the most secure.

### Question 159

A junior data engineer is migrating a workload from a relational database system to the Databricks Lakehouse. The source system uses a star schema, leveraging foreign key constraints and multi-table inserts to validate records on write.Which consideration will impact the decisions made by the engineer while migrating this workload?

- A.Databricks only allows foreign key constraints on hashed identifiers, which avoid collisions in highly-parallel writes.
- B.Foreign keys must reference a primary key field; multi-table inserts must leverage Delta Lake’s upsert functionality.
- C.Committing to multiple tables simultaneously requires taking out multiple table locks and can lead to a state of deadlock.
- D.All Delta Lake transactions are ACID compliant against a single table, and Databricks does not enforce foreign key constraints.

---

### Question 160

A data architect has heard about Delta Lake’s built-in versioning and time travel capabilities. For auditing purposes, they have a requirement to maintain a full record of all valid street addresses as they appear in the customers table.The architect is interested in implementing a Type 1 table, overwriting existing records with new values and relying on Delta Lake time travel to support long-term auditing. A data engineer on the project feels that a Type 2 table will provide better performance and scalability.Which piece of information is critical to this decision?

- A.Data corruption can occur if a query fails in a partially completed state because Type 2 tables require setting multiple fields in a single update.
- B.Shallow clones can be combined with Type 1 tables to accelerate historic queries for long-term versioning.
- C.Delta Lake time travel cannot be used to query previous versions of these tables because Type 1 changes modify data files in place.
- D.Delta Lake time travel does not scale well in cost or latency to provide a long-term versioning solution.

Only the "registration" topic contains Personal Identifiable Information (PII). The company wishes to restrict access to PII. The company also wishes to only retain records containing PII in this table for 14 days after initial ingestion. However, for non-PII information, it would like to retain these records indefinitely.Which solution meets the requirements?

- A.All data should be deleted biweekly; Delta Lake's time travel functionality should be leveraged to maintain a history of non-PII information.
- B.Data should be partitioned by the registration field, allowing ACLs and delete statements to be set for the PII directory.
- C.Data should be partitioned by the topic field, allowing ACLs and delete statements to leverage partition boundaries.

### Question 196

![Question 196 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_196_img_1.png)

A data architect has designed a system in which two Structured Streaming jobs will concurrently write to a single bronze Delta table. Each job is subscribing to a different topic from an Apache Kafka source, but they will write data with the same schema. To keep the directory structure simple, a data engineer has decided to nest a checkpoint directory to be shared by both streams.The proposed directory structure is displayed below:Which statement describes whether this checkpoint directory structure is valid for the given scenario and why?

- A.No; Delta Lake manages streaming checkpoints in the transaction log.
- B.Yes; both of the streams can share a single checkpoint directory.
- C.No; only one stream can write to a Delta Lake table.
- D.No; each of the streams needs to have its own checkpoint directory.

---

### Question 197

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement?

- A.Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.
- B.Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill.
- C.The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.
- D.Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.

---

### Question 198

Which statement describes the default execution mode for Databricks Auto Loader?

- A.Cloud vendor-specific queue storage and notification services are configured to track newly arriving files; new files are incrementally and idempotently loaded into the target Delta Lake table.
- B.New files are identified by listing the input directory; the target table is materialized by directly querying all valid files in the source directory.
- C.Webhooks trigger a Databricks job to run anytime new data arrives in a source directory; new data are automatically merged into target tables using rules inferred from the data.
- D.New files are identified by listing the input directory; new files are incrementally and idempotently loaded into the target Delta Lake table.

---

### Question 199

Which statement describes the correct use of pyspark.sql.functions.broadcast?

- A.It marks a column as having low enough cardinality to properly map distinct values to available partitions, allowing a broadcast join.
- B.It marks a column as small enough to store in memory on all executors, allowing a broadcast join.
- C.It caches a copy of the indicated table on all nodes in the cluster for use in all future queries during the cluster lifetime.
- D.It marks a DataFrame as small enough to store in memory on all executors, allowing a broadcast join.

---

### Question 200

Spill occurs as a result of executing various wide transformations. However, diagnosing spill requires one to proactively look for key indicators.Where in the Spark UI are two of the primary indicators that a partition is spilling to disk?

- A.Stage’s detail screen and Query’s detail screen
- B.Stage’s detail screen and Executor’s log files
- C.Driver’s and Executor’s log files
- D.Executor’s detail screen and Executor’s log files

### Question 201

![Question 201 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_201_img_1.png)

An upstream source writes Parquet data as hourly batches to directories named with the current date. A nightly batch job runs the following code to ingest all data from the previous day as indicated by the date variable:Assume that the fields customer_id and order_id serve as a composite key to uniquely identify each order.If the upstream system is known to occasionally produce duplicate entries for a single order hours apart, which statement is correct?

- A.Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, and only those records without duplicates in the target table will be written.
- B.Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, but newly written records may have duplicates already present in the target table.
- C.Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records; if existing records with the same key are present in the target table, these records will be overwritten.
- D.Each write to the orders table will run deduplication over the union of new and existing records, ensuring no duplicate records are present.

---

### Question 202

![Question 202 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_202_img_1.png)

---

### Question 203

A new data engineer notices that a critical field was omitted from an application that writes its Kafka source to Delta Lake. This happened even though the critical field was in the Kafka source. That field was further missing from data written to dependent, long-term storage. The retention threshold on the Kafka service is seven days. The pipeline has been in production for three months.Which describes how Delta Lake can help to avoid data loss of this nature in the future?

- A.The Delta log and Structured Streaming checkpoints record the full history of the Kafka producer.
- B.Delta Lake schema evolution can retroactively calculate the correct value for newly added fields, as long as the data was in the original source.
- C.Delta Lake automatically checks that all fields present in the source data are included in the ingestion layer.
- D.Ingesting all raw data and metadata from Kafka to a bronze Delta table creates a permanent, replayable history of the data state.

- A.The silver_customer_sales table will be overwritten by aggregated values calculated from all records in the gold_customer_lifetime_sales_summary table as a batch job.
- B.A batch job will update the gold_customer_lifetime_sales_summary table, replacing only those rows that have different values than the current version of the table, using customer_id as the primary key.
- C.The gold_customer_lifetime_sales_summary table will be overwritten by aggregated values calculated from all records in the silver_customer_sales table as a batch job.
- D.An incremental job will detect if new rows have been written to the silver_customer_sales table; if new rows are detected, all aggregates will be recalculated and used to overwrite the gold_customer_lifetime_sales_summary table.

### Question 205

The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system?

- A.Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.
- B.Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.
- C.Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.
- D.Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.

---

### Question 206

The data architect has mandated that all tables in the Lakehouse should be configured as external (also known as "unmanaged") Delta Lake tables.Which approach will ensure that this requirement is met?

- A.When a database is being created, make sure that the LOCATION keyword is used.
- B.When the workspace is being configured, make sure that external cloud object storage has been mounted.
- C.When data is saved to a table, make sure that a full file path is specified alongside the USING DELTA clause.
- D.When tables are created, make sure that the UNMANAGED keyword is used in the CREATE TABLE statement.

---

### Question 207

To reduce storage and compute costs, the data engineering team has been tasked with curating a series of aggregate tables leveraged by business intelligence dashboards, customer-facing applications, production machine learning models, and ad hoc analytical queries.The data engineering team has been made aware of new requirements from a customer-facing application, which is the only downstream workload they manage entirely. As a result, an aggregate table used by numerous teams across the organization will need to have a number of fields renamed, and additional fields will also be added.Which of the solutions addresses the situation while minimally interrupting other teams in the organization without increasing the number of tables that need to be managed?

- A.Send all users notice that the schema for the table will be changing; include in the communication the logic necessary to revert the new table schema to match historic queries.
- B.Configure a new table with all the requisite fields and new names and use this as the source for the customer-facing application; create a view that maintains the original data schema and table name by aliasing select fields from the new table.
- C.Create a new table with the required schema and new fields and use Delta Lake's deep clone functionality to sync up changes committed to one table to the corresponding table.
- D.Replace the current table definition with a logical view defined with the query logic currently writing the aggregate table; create a new table to power the customer-facing application.

### Question 209

![Question 209 Image 1](examtopics_images/question_209_img_1.png)

The downstream consumers of a Delta Lake table have been complaining about data quality issues impacting performance in their applications. Specifically, they have complained that invalid latitude and longitude values in the activity_details table have been breaking their ability to use other geolocation processes.A junior engineer has written the following code to add CHECK constraints to the Delta Lake table:A senior engineer has confirmed the above logic is correct and the valid ranges for latitude and longitude are provided, but the code fails when executed.Which statement explains the cause of this failure?

- A.The current table schema does not contain the field valid_coordinates; schema evolution will need to be enabled before altering the table to add a constraint.
- B.The activity_details table already exists; CHECK constraints can only be added during initial table creation.
- C.The activity_details table already contains records that violate the constraints; all existing data must pass CHECK constraints in order to add them to an existing table.
- D.The activity_details table already contains records; CHECK constraints can only be added prior to inserting values into a table.

---

### Question 210

What is true for Delta Lake?

- A.Views in the Lakehouse maintain a valid cache of the most recent versions of source tables at all times.
- B.Primary and foreign key constraints can be leveraged to ensure duplicate values are never entered into a dimension table.

### Question 219

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production?

- A.The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.
- B.The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.
- C.Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.
- D.Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.

### Question 229

A junior data engineer is working to implement logic for a Lakehouse table named silver_device_recordings. The source data contains 100 unique fields in a highly nested JSON structure.The silver_device_recordings table will be used downstream for highly selective joins on a number of fields, and will also be leveraged by the machine learning team to filter on a handful of relevant fields. In total, 15 fields have been identified that will often be used for filter and join logic.The data engineer is trying to determine the best approach for dealing with these nested fields before declaring the table schema.Which of the following accurately presents information about Delta Lake and Databricks that may impact their decision-making process?

- A.Because Delta Lake uses Parquet for data storage, Dremel encoding information for nesting can be directly referenced by the Delta transaction log.
- B.Schema inference and evolution on Databricks ensure that inferred types will always accurately match the data types used by downstream systems.
- C.The Tungsten encoding used by Databricks is optimized for storing string data; newly-added native support for querying JSON strings means that string types are always most efficient.
- D.By default, Delta Lake collects statistics on the first 32 columns in a table; these statistics are leveraged for data skipping when executing selective queries.

A data team is working to optimize an existing large, fast-growing table 'orders' with high cardinality columns, which experiences significant data skew and requires frequent concurrent writes. The team notice that the columns 'user_id', 'event_timestamp' and 'product_id' are heavily used in analytical queries and filters, although those keys may be subject to change in the future due to different business requirements.Which partitioning strategy should the team choose to optimize the table for immediate data skipping, incremental management over time, and flexibility?

- A.Partition the table with: ALTER TABLE orders PARTITION BY user_id, product_id, event_timestamp
- B.Use z-order after partitiing the table: OPTIMIZE orders ZORDER BY (user_id, product_id) WHERE event_timestamp = current date () - 1 DAY
- C.Cluster the table with: ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY user_id, product_id, event_timestamp
- D.Z-order the table with OPTIMIZE orders ZORDER BY (user_id, product_id, event_timestamp)
